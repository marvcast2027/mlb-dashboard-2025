    "**Error: Incorrect CSV Delimiter When Loading Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Problem:* The MLB batting statistics data does not export directly into a file so I had to copy and paste the data into a .txt file, and then convert to a CSV file. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Initial attempt:*\n",
    "```\n",

    "# Result: All data appeared in one column instead of being properly separated\n",

    "\n",
    "*Cause:* The downloaded .txt file used tab-delimited format, not comma-separated values. When pandas defaults to comma delimiter, it couldn't find any commas to split on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When exporting .txt file to CSV I made sure to select tab delimiter instead of comma. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Lesson learned:* Always inspect the raw data file first to identify the delimiter. Common delimiters include:\n",
    "- Comma (`,`) for .csv files\n",
    "- Tab (`\\t`) for tab-separated files\n",
    "- Pipe (`|`) for some database exports\n",
    "- Semicolon (`;`) for some European formats\n",

    "**General Debugging Tips**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check your data structure first:** Always use `df.head()` immediately after loading to verify columns loaded correctly\n",

    "1. **Team Dropdown**  \n",
    "   This control allows the user to switch between viewing the entire league or filtering to a specific team. When a team is selected, all charts and the summary table update to show only players from that team. This helps compare team level offensive identity and identify standout hitters within a single roster.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Minimum Plate Appearances Slider**  \n",
    "   This slider lets the user set a threshold for minimum playing time. Players with very few plate appearances can distort hitting metrics (for example, for a player to be eligible for MLB awards such MVP, Silver Slugger, etc they need a minimum of 502 plate appearances across 162 games). Therefore, By adjusting `Min PA`, the user can remove small sample outliers and focus on everyday starters or high usage players.\n",
